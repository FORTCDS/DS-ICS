# DS-ICS
DS-ICS is a multimedia project software system synthesis suite that contains four main modules.
DS-ICS implements the latest object detection algorithm, which is written in java.
In various projects, DS-ICS solves the procedural issues of each partner licensor with good performance and features.

# Introduction
Our team is made up of technicians from all over the world, with friends from the US, China, Singapore, India.We are a non-profit organization.
DS-ICS' goal is to research and deliver high quality, high performance code solutions that are designed to support the latest implementations and assessments.
DS-ICS mainly contains the following modules
* DSSYNCHRONIZE SECURITY MODULE
* DS PROCOTOL
* PROCOTOL HEARBEAT MECHANISM
* BASEDS

# Features
* 1、Use DSSYNCHRONIZE SECURITY MODULE for DS positioning.
* 2、DS positioning requires an additional module PROCOTOL HEARBEAT MECHANISM to activate the waiting program to receive the DS positioning command.
* 3、The DS PROCOTOL custom DS command terminal real-time demonstration is required when the project is in progress.
* 4、To meet cross-platform needs DSSYNCHRONIZE SECURITY MODULE needs to be developed in Java.
* 5、BASEDS DECRYPTION REQUIRES MANUAL OPERATION.
* 6、Check if the time period is executed synchronously.
* 7、Central control system.
* 8、Use DS PROCOTOL for data communication based on DS positioning.
* 9、Remote control command.
* 10、Can control hardware.
* 11、Real-time update of signal power.
* 12、Custom add hardware devices.
* 13、Use BASEDS to inject the registry to read the decrypted file to perform DS positioning content loading.
* 14、Meet the auxiliary standby DS positioning command in the LAN to ignore the main control server and directly perform peer-to-peer communication.



# The computer language used contains
* Java
* c#
* Python

# Use
We provide test programs. They can be integrated into the project. The android test program can be debugged directly. The windows program is just sdk.If you want to get a test sdk, please contact us,Our contact information is at the bottom!

# Principle
Integration only takes a few lines of code.
```
if ((((Boolean)Config.recevice.get(F)).booleanValue()) && 
        (((Boolean)Config.recevice.get(D)).booleanValue()))
      {
        for (;;)
        {
          DS.send(SYNCHRONIZE, IP, PORT);
        }
```     
# Help
First, check the troubleshooting section and our FAQs in our installation instructions. If you can't find help here, please let us know. We hope that the problem page becomes a forum for the community to solve problems together.
